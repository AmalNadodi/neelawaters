    <h2>Experience A Beachfront Vacation</h2>
    <p>If you are wondering where to stay in Alleppey, the beach is an ideal choice, conveniently situated but away from the hustle and bustle of town life. What makes our private beach house so unique is the location: our rooms are not near Alleppey beach; they are on Alleppey beach itself: you could not be closer to the wind and waves, white sand, coconut trees – the ideal place for a walk, swim or just watching the wildlife that crosses this stretch of water.</p>

      <p>Rentals at Neela Waters provide a traditional Alleppey homestay in the true sense of the word: we are a family run business and we live on the ground floor of the property so are always on hand for advice and support. As our reviews testify, our accommodation has the feel of a beach cottage, yet the ample luxury of beach resorts, affording you the most comfortable stay at competitive rates and suitable for a wide range of travellers from families to honeymoon couples. </p>

      <p>We have four rooms on the beach, three of which are sea-facing rooms and open onto a sizeable balcony from which to enjoy the blazing sunsets. All four spacious rooms are furnished to an exceptionally high-standard but are designed to maintain the style of Kerala heritage homes, both in colour scheme and through the use of our signature original teak-wood arch windows. All rooms have artistically tiled attached bathrooms in which you can enjoy a hot shower or bath facing the ocean. </p>

      <p>This was by far the loveliest homestay we’ve stayed at on our journey. It felt very much like staying with friends. Joanna and Nachi made us feel super relaxed and welcome, in their beautiful home. Would definitely return if we come to Alleppey again and would certainly recommend to others! </p>
